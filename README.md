# Network Speed Test Client-Server Application
This is a client-server application designed to perform network speed tests using both UDP and TCP protocols. The application allows the client to request a file transfer from the server, specifying the file size and the number of connections for each protocol. The server then handles the requests and provides performance metrics, such as the time taken for the transfer and the speed in bits per second.
